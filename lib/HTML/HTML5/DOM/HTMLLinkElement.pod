=item * C<< protocol >>

A shortcut for C<< $elem->href->scheme >>. (Does not act as a setter.)

=item * C<< rel >>

Called with no arguments, is a shortcut for C<< $elem->getAttribute("rel") >>. Called with a defined argument, acts as C<setAttribute>. Called with undef as an argument, acts as C<removeAttribute>.

=item * C<< relList >>

Splits C<< $elem->getAttribute("rel") >> into a list on whitespace.

=item * C<< rev >>

=item * C<< revList >>

Splits C<< $elem->getAttribute("rev") >> into a list on whitespace.

=item * C<< search >>

A shortcut for C<< $elem->href->query >>. (Does not act as a setter.)

=item * C<< target >>
