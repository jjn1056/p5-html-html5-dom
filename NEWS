NEWS
  HTML::HTML5::DOM 0.001
    July 2012.

    HTML::HTML5::DOM is the culmination of an idea I've been working on in
    some form or another for about six months. The idea is to build an HTML
    DOM layer on top of XML::LibXML.

    XML::LibXML is not really designed to be extensible in this way, so to
    start with I needed to write XML::LibXML::Augment, a module to assist in
    subclassing XML::LibXML's node classes.

    With that in place I was free to start implementing the HTML5 DOM.
    Version 0.001 is a relatively modest proof of concept. There are still a
    number of methods that are only partially implemented. Many more have
    not even been attempted yet. But it's my hope that eventually the whole
    HTML5 DOM will be covered.

   Major Features Planned
    Plans can change.

    *   Lots of methods marked "@@TODO" will be implemented.

    *   W3C RDFa API.

    *   W3C Microdata API.

   Features At Risk
    *   HTMLFormElement's "submit" method might be better off returning an
        HTTP::Request object rather than Web::Magic.
